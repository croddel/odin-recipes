    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When I was a kid, polenta was my least favorite thing to eat, but also my
      favorite meal. I know that sounds impossible, but allow me to explain. I
      wasn't a big fan of the taste and texture of polenta, but above and beyond
      that, it wasn't spaghetti, ravioli, or lasagna, which I enjoyed so much
      more. However, I adored the way my grandparents served polenta, so despite
      not eating very much of it, I always looked forward to the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather would cook up a big pot of the stuff, and when it was done,
      he'd dump it on a huge piece of plywood that had been set on the table. It
      almost covered a table large enough for six people, and once the molten
      mush had been spread evenly over the oiled wood, a pot of meat sauce would
      be placed nearby. There was usually a salad, some cheese, and bread, and
      everyone would grab a fork, and start eating right off the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      That might not sound like that big of a deal now, but for a small kid,
      eating food without a plate is pretty thrilling stuff. I'd mostly eat the
      meats and bread, with a few bites of polenta mixed in, which I now realize
      was slightly undercooked. If you don't cook polenta enough, it has a sandy
      texture, as well as a raw, bitter aftertaste. Everything else they made
      was amazing, so my grandparents get a pass, but that's one reason I loved
      this polenta lasagna loaf so much. After boiling, and then baking, the
      cornmeal is sweet, soft, and absolutely delicious. My only regret is not
      being able to eat it off the table. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Polenta</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked coarse-ground polenta</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>0.5 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>0.66 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>0.25 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Baking/Serving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups hot prepared meat sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare polenta: Bring water and salt to a boil over high heat. Whisk
        polenta into the boiling water and continue whisking until it starts to
        thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring
        often, until polenta is soft and has lost its grainy texture, 25 to 40
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove polenta from the stove and quickly whisk in butter and
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer polenta to a silicone baking liner (or oiled foil or parchment
        paper). Spread it out evenly almost to the edges into an 8x13-inch
        rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and smooth out the top with your
        hands. Place a baking sheet on top and press slightly to further
        flatten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide the silicone liner and polenta onto the baking sheet and place in
        the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove polenta from the refrigerator and cut, from one long edge to the
        other, into 8-inch long strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare filling: Stir ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mozzarella, salt,
        pepper, cayenne, egg, and parsley in a bowl until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan
        with 1 tablespoon oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place one strip of polenta into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan.
        Spread 1/3 of the filling on top as evenly as you can. Top with about 1
        cup hot meat sauce. Repeat polenta-filling-sauce layers twice more.
        Place the last piece of polenta on top, then gently shake and tap the
        pan to settle the contents. Place the loaf pan on top of a sheet pan to
        catch any spills while baking. Loosely wrap the top of the loaf pan with
        foil, making sure it's not touching the polenta.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, discard foil, and let rest for at least 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide onto 6 plates. Garnish with parsley and serve with additional
        sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
