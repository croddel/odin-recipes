    <h2>Description</h2>

      When I was a kid, polenta was my least favorite thing to eat, but also my
      favorite meal. I know that sounds impossible, but allow me to explain. I
      wasn't a big fan of the taste and texture of polenta, but above and beyond
      that, it wasn't spaghetti, ravioli, or lasagna, which I enjoyed so much
      more. However, I adored the way my grandparents served polenta, so despite
      not eating very much of it, I always looked forward to the experience.

      My grandfather would cook up a big pot of the stuff, and when it was done,
      he'd dump it on a huge piece of plywood that had been set on the table. It
      almost covered a table large enough for six people, and once the molten
      mush had been spread evenly over the oiled wood, a pot of meat sauce would
      be placed nearby. There was usually a salad, some cheese, and bread, and
      everyone would grab a fork, and start eating right off the board.

      That might not sound like that big of a deal now, but for a small kid,
      eating food without a plate is pretty thrilling stuff. I'd mostly eat the
      meats and bread, with a few bites of polenta mixed in, which I now realize
      was slightly undercooked. If you don't cook polenta enough, it has a sandy
      texture, as well as a raw, bitter aftertaste. Everything else they made
      was amazing, so my grandparents get a pass, but that's one reason I loved
      this polenta lasagna loaf so much. After boiling, and then baking, the
      cornmeal is sweet, soft, and absolutely delicious. My only regret is not
      being able to eat it off the table. Enjoy!
